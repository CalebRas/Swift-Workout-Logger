# Overview

This program is a simple command-line workout logger written in Swift. Once started, it allows the user to store the sets with the weight they completed in their last workout. The sets are saved to a specific exercise, and target muscle falling under a muscle group in the Push, Pull, Legs split. For example, the user could save three sets of 225 to Bench Press falling under the Chest muscle, which would be part of the Push muscle group. Each one of the muscle groups comes preloaded with some exercises, but exercises can be added and deleted. The sets for each exercise can also easily be edited and viewed after they have been inputted. 

I created this software as an exercise in learning Swift syntax along with Xcode, since I previously did not have any experience with either. This project allowed me to get to know my way around Xcode and the associated file structure as I created a working Mac command line application I'll actually use. It also allowed me to dive into Swift 5 syntax as I covered the basics of variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, and functions. The custom classes and Data structures I designed will give me a decent base for a similar iOS app I plan to develop in the near future.

# Development Environment
* Xcode 13.2.1
* Swift 5.5.3

# Useful Websites
* [Xcode 13](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* [Swift Documentation](https://www.swift.org/documentation/)
* [Swift “Hello, World!” Program ](https://www.programiz.com/swift-programming/hello-world)

# Future Work
Here are some of the features I plan on adding in the future:
* Add a date and reps to display with the sets
* Allow data storage through reading and writing to a file
* Integate into a iOS app for mobile use
